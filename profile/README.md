## Welcome to Berry Battle!
Berry Battle is a game simulator that officiates a match between two Raspberry Pi devices running user defined AI algorithms that are trained to defeat an opposing team.

The inspiration for Berry Battle comes from the excellent code competition [Battlecode](https://battlecode.org/). 

The primary motivations for Berry Battle include:
  - Completions that are open to everyone.
  - Level playing field with low barrier for entry.
  - Flexible and scalable.
  - Language agnostic
  - Automation
